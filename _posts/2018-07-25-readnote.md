**Image registration** is a key component for medical image analysis to provide spatial correspondences.

## Image Registration Background

[[My Literature Review]](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-31-ImageRegistration/)


## Contributions

**(0)** Unlike previous methods, the DIRNet is not trained with known registration transformations, but learns to register images by directly optimizing a similarity metric between the fixed and the moving image. 

**(1)** propose a deep learning network for de- formable image registration (DIRNet), which consists of a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) regressor, a spatial transformer, and a resampler. 

**(2)** generates the displacement vector field that enables the resampler to warp the moving image to the fixed image.

**(3)** end-to-end by unsupervised optimization of a similarity metric between input image pairs.

**(4)** A trained DIRNet can be applied to perform registration **on unseen image pairs in one pass**, thus non-iteratively. Evaluation

## Performance

DIRNet had been evaluated with registration of images with **handwritten digits** and **image slices from cine cardiac MRI** scans.
