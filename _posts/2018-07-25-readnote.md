**Image registration** is a key component for medical image analysis to provide spatial correspondences.


## Contributions

**(0)** Unlike previous methods, the DIRNet is not trained with known registration transformations, but learns to register images by directly optimizing a similarity metric between the fixed and the moving image. 

**(1)** propose a deep learning network for de- formable image registration (DIRNet), which consists of a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) regressor, a spatial transformer, and a resampler. 

**(2)** generates the displacement vector field that enables the resampler to warp the moving image to the fixed image.

**(3)** end-to-end by unsupervised optimization of a similarity metric between input image pairs.

**(4)** A trained DIRNet can be applied to perform registration **on unseen image pairs in one pass**, thus non-iteratively. Evaluation

## Background

Wu et al. [[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7314894/): "used a convolutional stacked auto-encoder (**CAE**) to extract features from fixed and moving images that are subsequently used in conventional deformable image registration algorithms. However, the CAE is decoupled from the image registration task and hence, it does not necessarily extract the features most descriptive for image registration. The training of the CAE was unsupervised, but the registration task was not learned end-to-end."

Miao et al. [[Reading Note]](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-23-readnote-add/) "used a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) regressor to predict a transformation matrix for rigid registration of synthetic 2D to 3D images. "

Liao et al. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10336) "used a ConvNet for intra-patient rigid registration of CT to cone-beam CT applied to either cardiac or abdominal images. "

"Both registration methods (Miao et al. and Liao et al.) were supervised: for training, transformation parameters were generated, which is task specific and highly challenging."

Jaderberg et al. [[Reading Note]](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-26-readnote/) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025)  *(‎Cited by 901)*: " introduced the spatial transformer network (STN) that can be used as a **building block that aligns input images in a larger network** that performs a particular task. By training the entire network end-to-end, the embedded STN deduces optimal alignment for solving that specific task. "
"**However, alignment is not guaranteed**, and it is only performed when required for the task of the entire network. The STNs were used for affine transformations, as well as deformable transformations using thin-plate splines. However, an STN needs many labeled training examples, and to the best of our knowledge,** **have not yet been used in medical imaging**."

## Performance

DIRNet had been evaluated with registration of images with **handwritten digits** and **image slices from cine cardiac MRI** scans.
