a generator minimizes the divergence between its generative distribution and the data distribution

WHILE

the discriminator tries to distinguish the samples from the generator’s distribution and the real data samples

AND THEN

the generator “wins” when the discriminator performs no better than random guess.


What's Wasserstein GANs


people have used Wasserstein distance to measure the divergence between two distribution
