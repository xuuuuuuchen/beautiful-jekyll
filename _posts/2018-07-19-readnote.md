**Title:** DetNet: A Backbone network for Object Detection [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06215)

**Authors:** Zeming Li, Chao Peng, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, Yangdong Deng, Jian Sun

**Association:** Tsinghua University, Face++

**Submission:** April 2018


## Contuibutions

**(1)** DetNet not only **maintains high spatial resolution** in deeper layers but also keeps large receptive field for object detection task (not like traditional backbone network).

**(2)** first to analyze the **inherent drawbacks of traditional ImageNet pre-trained model** for fine-tunning recent object detectors.

**(3)** DetNet achieves new state-of-the-art results on MSCOCO **object detection** and instance **segmentation** track based on a low complexity DetNet59 backbone.

## Background

The performance of object detection has been significantly improved due to the rapid progress of deep convolutional neural networks [ In the Paper: ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06215)[8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].

CNN based object detectors can be categorized into:

| one-stage detector | two-stage detectors |
| :------ |:--- | 
| YOLO [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | Faster R-CNN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 
| SSD [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | R-FCN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 
| RetinaNet [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | FPN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 


## Motivation

Due to the **gap** between the image classification and object detection:

| Image Classification | Object Detection |
| :------ |:--- | 
| higher spatial resolution -> higher receptive field -> more **beneficial** to the visual classification | higher spatial resolution -> **compromises** the large objects location -> **fail to** small objects recognision| 

{: .box-warning}
**However:** high resolution feature maps bring more challenges to build a deep neural network due to the **computational and memory cost**.

To keep the efficiency of our DetNet, we employ a low complexity dilated bottleneck structure. 


## DetNet Design

ResNet-50 as our baseline.

## Performance

There are two key-points in object detection evaluation, the one is average precision (**AP**) and the other is average recall (**AR**). 

AR means how much objects we can find out, 
AP means how much objects is correctly predicted (right label for classification). 

AP and AR are usually evaluated on different IoU threshold to **validate the regression capability** for object location. The larger IoU is, the more accurate regression needs. 

AP and AR are also evaluated on** different range of bounding box areas** (small, middle, and large) to find the detail influences on the scale objects.
