## Contuibution

{: .box-note}
**1:** This is a notification Hello World.


{: .box-note}
**2:** DetNet maintains high spatial resolution in deeper layers for enlarging the receptive field for image classification, (not like traditional backbone network)

The inherent drawbacks of traditional ImageNet pre-trained model for fine-tunning recent object detectors is analyzed.

A novel backbone, called DetNet, is proposed, which is specifically designed for object detection task by maintaining the spatial resolution and enlarging the receptive field


## Methods

**Background**

The performance of object detection has been significantly improved due to the rapid progress of deep convolutional neural networks [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].

CNN based object detectors can be categorized into:

| one-stage detector | two-stage detectors |
| :------ |:--- | 
| YOLO [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | Faster R-CNN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 
| SSD [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | R-FCN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 
| RetinaNet [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | FPN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 


**Motivation**



Due to the **gap** between the image classification and object detection:

| image classification | object detection |
| :------ |:--- | 
| Hello | World |
