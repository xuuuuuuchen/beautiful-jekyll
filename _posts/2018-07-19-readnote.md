## Contuibution

{: .box-note}
**1:** DetNet not only **maintains high spatial resolution** in deeper layers but also keeps large receptive field for object detection task, (not like traditional backbone network)
{: .box-note}
**2:** first to analyze the **inherent drawbacks of traditional ImageNet pre-trained model** for fine-tunning recent object detectors
{: .box-note}
**3:** DetNet achieves new state-of-the-art results on MSCOCO **object detection** and instance **segmentation** track based on a low complexity DetNet59 backbone.

##Background

The performance of object detection has been significantly improved due to the rapid progress of deep convolutional neural networks [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].

CNN based object detectors can be categorized into:

| one-stage detector | two-stage detectors |
| :------ |:--- | 
| YOLO [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | Faster R-CNN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 
| SSD [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | R-FCN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 
| RetinaNet [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/) | FPN [Reading Note](https://xuuuuuuchen.github.io/2018-07-19-readnote/)| 


## Motivation

Due to the **gap** between the image classification and object detection:

| Image Classification | Object Detection |
| :------ |:--- | 
| higher spatial resolution -> higher receptive field -> more **beneficial** to the visual classification | higher spatial resolution -> **compromises** the large objects location -> **fail to** small objects recognision| 


{: .box-warning}
**However:** high resolution feature maps bring more challenges to build a deep neural network due to the **computational and memory cost**.

To keep the efficiency of our DetNet, we employ a low complexity dilated bottleneck structure.
