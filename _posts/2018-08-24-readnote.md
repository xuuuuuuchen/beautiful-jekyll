## Motivation


## Contributions

**(0)** define registration as a parametric function, and optimize its parameters given a set of images from a collection of interest. Given

**(1)** (OPEN SOURCE) code is available at https://github.com/balakg/voxelmorph


**(2)** present a learning-based solution requiring no supervised information such as ground truth correspon- dences or anatomical landmarks during training,

**(3)** propose a CNN function with parameters shared across a population, enabling registration to be achieved through a function evaluation

**(4)** enables parameter optimization for a variety of cost functions, which can be adapted to various tasks.

## Methods

## Loss function


consisting of two components:

- penalizes differences in appearance **L_sim**

And set **L_sim** to the negative local cross-correlation of M(φ) and F.

- penalizes local spatial variations in φ **L_smooth**
