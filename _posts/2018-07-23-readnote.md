**Image registration** is a key component for medical image analysis to provide spatial correspondences.

## Background

Image registration = an optimization problem = optimizing the parameters of a transformation model

Process:
1. Detect features.
>sdsdsd

2. Match corresponinging features.
3. Infer geometric transformation.
4. Use the geometric transformation to align one image with the other.



## Motivation

**(1)**  "achieve the best possible agreement between a transformed source and a target image, subject to transformation constraints."


## Network Design

inspired by the GoogleNet model for image classification.

## Limitations

"YOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that our model can predict. Our model struggles with **small objects** that appear in groups, such as flocks of birds. "

"Since our model learns to predict bounding boxes from data, it struggles to generalize to objects in **new or unusual **aspect ratios or configurations. Our model also uses rela- tively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since our architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the input image. "

"Finally, while we train on a loss function that approximates detection performance, our loss function treats errors the same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding boxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but **a small error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU**. Our main source of error is **incorrect localizations**."
